NB. Fourier series are periodic  
##Gibbs Phenomena:
For the discrete point of the function, the fourier approximation is oscillating
Since we truncate the formula by define the K.
If K goes infinite, then the oscillation goes away

If K >= n/2, them the phenomena is derived.
Because the plot we made is actually a bunch of points.
So keep K the same, if we double n, then the Gibbs Phen. comes back.

**Fourier transform**
$$\mathcal{F}(f(x)) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\mathrm{e}^{-iwx}\mathrm{d}x$$
