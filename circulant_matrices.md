Each row is obtained by a circular shift from the previous row
It is shift invariant:
$$C(S_{k}x) = S_{k}C(x)$$
So you can say that  $C$ and $S_{k}$ are mutually commuting

The eigenvalues of a circulant matrix is its DFT for each value of the row

**2.simultaneously diagnalizable**
for each M in $\mathrm{M}$

$\Lambda = V^{-1} M V$  $\Lambda$ is diagonal

A lemma: A, B has simple eigenvalues
A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable $iff$ they commute
